The RPMFusion provides some free and non-free software for Fedora. The repo can be used via the command line. The repository is meant to provide stable and tested packages for Fedora so it is highly recommended to activate it on your system with:

	rpm -ivh http://download1.rpmfusion.org/free/fedora/rpmfusion-free-release-stable.noarch.rpm
